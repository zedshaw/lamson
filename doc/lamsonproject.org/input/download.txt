Title: Downloading Lamson

You can get the Lamson *source*, read "the source releases":/releases/ documentation to
find out how.

For people who can't click the above link, and who still want the source code, do:

<pre class="code">
bzr branch lp:lamson
</pre>

But really you should read the read "the source releases":/releases/ documentation to
find out how.

h2. Installing With Easy Install

Using easy_install is the easiest way to install, simply run "sudo easy_install lamson" and
it will do the work of getting the dependencies and setting everything up.

h2. Installing With setup.py

Once you get the source, you can also use setup.py to install Lamson.  First make sure that
you have *Mako*, and *nose* installed:

<pre class="code">
$ sudo easy_install sqlalchemy
$ sudo easy_install jinja
$ sudo easy_install nose
</pre>

If you refuse to use easy_install entirely then it is on you to find these projects and 
install them how you see best.  *Make sure you have the most recent version of all 
dependencies.*

Then you can use this command to install:

<pre class="code">
$ python setup.py install
</pre>

h2. Installing Into A Virtual Env

Read the instructions "for installing with virtual env":/docs/lamson_virtual_env.html in the "documentation":/docs/ section.
