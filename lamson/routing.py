"""
The meat of Lamson, doing all the work that actually takes an email and makes
sure that your code gets it.

The three most important parts for a programmer are the Router variable, the
StateStorage base class, and the @route, @route_like, and @stateless decorators.

The lamson.routing.Router variable (it's not a class, just named like one) is
how the whole system gets to the Router.  It is an instance of RoutingBase and
there's usually only one.

The lamson.routing.StateStorage is what you need to implement if you want Lamson
to store the state in a different way.  By default the lamson.routing.Router
object just uses a default MemoryStorage to do its job.  If you want to use a
custom storage, then in your config/boot.py (or config/testing.py) you would set
lamson.routing.Router.STATE_STORE to what you want to use.

Finally, when you write a state handler, it has functions that act as state
functions for dealing with each state.  To tell the Router what function should
handle what email you use a @route decorator.  To tell the Route that one
function routes the same as another use @route_like.  In the case where a state
function should run on every matching email, just use the @stateless decorator
after a @route or @route_like.

If at any time you need to debug your routing setup just use the lamson routes
command.

Routing Control
===============

To control routing there are a set of decorators that you apply to your
functions.

* @route -- The main routing function that determines what addresses you are
interested in.
* @route_like -- Says that this function routes like another one.
* @stateless -- Indicates this function always runs on each route encountered, and
no state is maintained.
* @nolocking -- Use this if you want this handler to run parallel without any
locking around Lamson internals.  SUPER DANGEROUS, add @stateless as well.
* @state_key_generator -- Used on a function that knows how to make your state
keys for the module, for example if module_name + message.route_to is needed to maintain
state.

It's best to put @route or @route_like as the first decorator, then the others 
after that.

The @state_key_generator is different since it's not intended to go on a handler
but instead on a simple function, so it shouldn't be combined with the others.

    The self is a globally accessible class that is actually more like a
    glorified module.  It is used mostly internally by the lamson.routing 
    decorators (route, route_like, stateless) to control the routing 
    mechanism.

    It keeps track of the registered routes, their attached functions, the
    order that these routes should be evaluated, any default routing captures,
    and uses the MemoryStorage by default to keep track of the states.

    You can change the storage to another implementation by simple setting:

        self.STATE_STORE = OtherStorage()

    In a config/settings.py file.

    RoutingBase does locking on every write to its internal data (which usually
    only happens during booting and reloading while debugging), and when each
    handler's state function is called.  ALL threads will go through this lock,
    but only as each state is run, so you won't have a situation where the chain
    of state functions will block all the others.  This means that while your
    handler runs nothing will be running, but you have not guarantees about 
    the order of each state function.

    However, this can kill the performance of some kinds of state functions,
    so if you find the need to not have locking, then use the @nolocking 
    decorator and the Router will NOT lock when that function is called.  That
    means while your @nolocking state function is running at least one other
    thread (more if the next ones happen to be @nolocking) could also be
    running.

    It's your job to keep things straight if you do that.

    STATE_STORE for different state control options.
